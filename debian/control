Description: user-space interfaces for TuxOnIce
 TuxOnIce is an alternative implementation to suspend a Linux machine
 by writing its state to memory for later resuming. A kernel patch for
 TuxOnIce is available separately.
 .
 This package provides several user interfaces which improve the
 user's experience during the suspend and resume processes. It is not
 needed for TuxOnIce functionality.
