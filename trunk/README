Suspend's userspace user interface appeared in 2.1.7 as a "Possibly broken
developer option". It allows you put the user interface of software suspend
into a userspace process which offers a great deal of flexibility as to what
can be done.

To get things going, you'll need the following:

 - A Software Suspend 2 enabled kernel with suspend_userui enabled either as a
   kernel module or compiled into the kernel.

   If you have fbsplash compiled into your kernel, you will be able to get the
   verbose splash screens for higher console levels for added eyecandy, but
   this is not required.

 - The userspace UI sources. These are available from the download page at
   http://www.suspend2.net/downloads/ under the "Userspace UI" section. You can
   also get bleeding edge code from the subversion repository:
     svn checkout http://svn.suspend2.net/suspend2-userui/trunk suspend2-userui

 - For suspend2_fbsplash - a suitable fbsplash theme. See
   http://wiki.suspend2.net/UserUI/Themes to grab one you like.

Steps:

1. After patching, compiling and booting your kernel, ensure the suspend_userui
   module is loaded. You probably also want to get rid of the suspend_text
   module which is most easily done by either not loading the module, or
   putting "echo 1 > /proc/software_suspend/disable_textmode_support" in your
   hibernate script ("ProcSetting disable_textmode_support 1" in
   hibernate.conf)

2. Download the userui sources from the website, extract the tarball, compile
   by running "make", and install with "make install".  This will create
   suspend2ui_text and suspend2ui_fbsplash and install them into
   /usr/local/sbin by default. The fbsplash module will only succeed in
   compiling if you have all the relevant libraries and dev files (libpng,
   libz, libjpeg, freetype2, lcms and libmng-1.0.5 or later).

3. In your hibernate script, put the path to the suspend2ui_text or
   suspend2ui_fbsplash binary into /proc/software_suspend/userui_program.

4. [This step is somewhat optional - if you omit it, you simply will not have a
    user interface for the first portion of resuming].
   Add the suspend2ui_text or suspend2ui_fbsplash binary to your initrd image
   and set your initrd script to set the userui_program path appropriately (if
   it is in a different location in the initrd image).

5. [This step for fbsplash only]
   Download your favourite fbsplash theme (see
   http://wiki.suspend2.net/UserUI/Themes). Extract the tarball into
   /etc/splash, and create a symlink called /etc/splash/suspend2 to point to
   your preferred theme. For example:

        /etc/splash# ln -s debian-black-suspend2 suspend2

   would set your theme to debian-black-suspend2.

   If you want to see the splash for the first portion of resuming too, you
   will need to put this theme into the initrd too.

6. Login on a console as root, and run "/usr/local/sbin/suspend2_fbsplash -t" (or
   suspend2_text) to check that everything goes to plan. This runs the user
   interface in test mode. If it doesn't work here, it's unlikely to work when
   suspending.

7. Suspend!
